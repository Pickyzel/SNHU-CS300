# SNHU-CS300
Within this course, it really tested my knowledge of pseudocode. Not only did I have to create pseudocode based on what a client had asked for, but I also then
had to implement it into working code for a finished product. The class gave prompts that separated what needed to be done. Working on one task at a time I was
able to slowly get everything done. For my final project, a binary search tree was the most important, but overall that was just for this project. Understanding
other data structures is vitally important for different future projects. Some roadblocks I came across, were understanding the prompts in front of me. The 
way I addressed that was by reaching out to my instructor in order to clear things up. Understanding data structures seems like something I need for any future 
career. I am very happy I took this class and will continue to expand my knowledge on the subject.
